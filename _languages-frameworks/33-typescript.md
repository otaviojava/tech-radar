# What is it ?
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
