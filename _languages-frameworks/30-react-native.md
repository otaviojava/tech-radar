# What is it ?
React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Facebook/Meta Platforms, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React library along with native platform capabilities. Written in JavaScriptâ€”rendered with native code, React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.
