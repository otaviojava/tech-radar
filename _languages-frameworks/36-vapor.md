# What is it ?
Vapor is an open-source web framework for building web applications and RESTful APIs using the Swift programming language. It was created with the goal of providing a high-performance, easy-to-use, and expressive web development experience for Swift developers. Some of the features of Vapor include routing, request and response handling, and support for databases and authentication. The framework also has a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily add new functionality by choosing the components they need and integrating them into their application.
